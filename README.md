# Generative & Dynamic Sound for your Projects
#### Workshop June 2017

_Note: Show screen with QuickTime, New Movie Recording, and a Connected iOS Device._

Sound is often an important part of installations, visuals, and other types of projects. In this session, we will learn how to develop a sonic awareness, capture field recordings, and use them with app called Field Scraper to created generative compositions. You do not need to be a musician or familiar with sound.

To follow along with the class I recommend getting the Field Scraper app, or you can always take notes and follow along afterward.

## Why is sound important?
Sound has the ability to transform or augment an experience, change the context of space & images, and should be considered as components of a project.

## Sound vs. Music
There is not a clear agreement among the general public about what is music and what is sound. One way to think is that sound is the raw material for music. Many artists decide to blur the boundaries between the two, bring up the timeless question "when does sound become music?". It becomes even trickier when we add generative elements, where the hand of the "author" is not at work.

#### Pauline Oliveros
Pauline Oliveros is a big influence of mine because she taught people to focus on sound through her method called Deep Listening. Following her ideas as change the way Iâ€™ve listened to music but also the way I experience spaces
- She transformed the experience of sound into a method of meditation and experience
- Separating sound, listening for differences, listening for direction

#### Editing your sounds
- Zooming in
- Selecting right/left channel, to view
- Setting In and Out point
- Alg finds points of silenct for cleaner trims
- Min analyzes the file to fine appropriate in out points

- Output your recordings
- If you want to send me your recordings. matthew.scott.ortega@gmail.com

## Homework
Last 30 minutes is to go collect some sounds from the floor and come back to see if we can transform some of them 15/15

- Spend the next 15 minutes trying to collect a couple of recordings. See if just in the space at ITP if you can find anything different and interesting.
- The next 15 minute we will present what we found.
